== What
I like to look stuff up, like TCP/IP port numbers, protocols, top-level
domains, et al. I get my data from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) and like to make it available to my programs. Since I am open sourcing
this code you can add this functionality to your own programs as well.

== How
The IANA Ruby module loads the data into conveniently searchable data
structures. The flat files the IANA Ruby module consume as data are hosted at
iana.org. You will need to fetch them so you can process the content locally.
I grab these files with with curl (but you can use wget or whatever if you
don't use curl):

curl -O http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers
curl -O http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers
curl -O http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt

== Examples
When you run the example programs, do it like so:

  ruby examples/ports.rb port-numbers

Use these example programs to see how you might use and otherwise integrate
IANA data functionality into your own programs.

== Install
This needs to be packaged up as a gem, and I will get around to it in the next
version, but in the mean time we do it the no frills way. Assuming Ruby 1.8,
try this:

  sudo cp lib/iana.rb /opt/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8
  sudo cp -R lib/iana /opt/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8

Once installed, you can simply call

  require 'iana'

in any Ruby program that makes use of the IANA module.

I haven't tested this code with YARV, so YMMV. :)

== Contribute
The source is availble at github. Feel free to clone it and implement your own
awesome ideas. You can also send your patches by email to yesmar@speakeasy.net.
